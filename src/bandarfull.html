                      Every bottle of Bandarful is expressive and full of life as a barrel of monkeys. And why not? After all, it is the Himalayan Langur and its adventures across barley fields, cane
                      farms, coffee estates and fruit trees that’s behind this farm to bottle, cold brew, Coffee Liqueur. The drink exudes natural goodness and a flavour that is unmistakably India at

                      Bandarful from Himmaleh Spirits is as much a product of nature as it is of an unusual collaboration. Here, neutral spirits made from hyperlocal barley and Himalayan water
                      exchange flavours with handpicked Arabica Coffee Cherries and Beans from Chikmagalur’s finest estates. The delicious flavour is not only distinctly Indian but also blends the
                      finest ingredients from its northern and southern reaches.

                              Bandarful’s well-guarded recipe can be traced back to its Himalayan origins – tree-topped terrain, hyperlocal plantation barley, farm-bred cane sugar, and their delicious
                              collaboration with monkey-picked, arabica estate Coffee from the southern district of Chikmagalur (the birthplace of Indian Coffee). Crafted by artful makers in a
                              pristine estate-distillery in Uttarakhand.

                              The world of Bandarful is like an eventful and yet collegial sanctuary - happy, unspoilt and full of life. And at times inventive. Very much like the Himalayan Langur
                              (and its gang of accomplices), that’s our muse and that is a central accomplice to making of this versatile liqueur. Life’s full of adventure, always fun and yet never
                              out of line. “Why so serious”? Is what he asks as he lords over his treetop kingdom in Kumaon and trades bounties with colleagues. This is a flavour of life that our
                              all-natural Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur captures so evocatively.

                              It has the same spell on its drinkers as the magical Kumaon, on our Himalayan Langur, and his forest companions. Hyperlocal and made with unflinchingly natural

                              What adds an unmistakable and unusual flavour to our unique cold brew Coffee Liqueur? Well, it’s a barrel, but not the usual one. It’s a barrel of monkeys and their
                              long-tailed exploits across barley fields and cane farms, fulsome estates and fruit orchards that inspires versatile Liqueur. Kumaon’s grower communities, the coffee
                              estate keepers of Chikmagalur, mother nature with her reserves of Himalayan spring water, tropical berries, and masterful distillers who make capital of it all, sum up
                              the wonderful world of Bandarful.

                      Bandarful is a provincial expression. It is an artisanal micro-liqueur that through its all-natural character, best captures the diversity of terroir and produce across the
                      length of India. This Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur is made in the charming estate-distillery of Himmaleh in Kumaon.

                      The neutral spirits made from hyperlocal barley and Himalayan water are blended with handpicked Coffee Cherries and Beans from the Arabica estates of Chikmagalur. Its flavours
                      are expressive and vivid and are the result of a crafted collaboration – craftsmen and nature.

                      As a digestif, dessert-drink, a cocktail companion or simply straight and neat, Bandarful remains adventurous and endearing. Easy to spot in a flint clear glass bottle and a
                      convenient bar-top neck finish. The range of Bandarful’s Coffee Liqueurs will include special edition variants with high quality single estate coffees sourced from some of the
                      most revered coffee districts in India including the Arakku valley, Coorg and Chikmagalur.

                This is a tale of the farms and the forest and everything wonderful and Himalayan in between, including a barrel of frolicsome monkeys and rich flora that are the life of Kumaon and
                its pristine wilderness. The chief of staff of course is our long-tailed, chatterbox Langur of Kumaon, one of its most expressive, jovial children. Liberty is something he is allowed
                to take, for life in Kumaon without him and his friends would be a tad boring and dull.

                Lording over its imaginary kingdom, cavorting across barley fields and cane farms, raiding estates and fruit orchards, chasing butterflies on a whim, it leads a rather charmed life -
                one of long-tailed exploits. Mother nature provides plenty for this collegial gang. Spring water, tropical berries, dense jungles, fulsome estates and indulgent grower communities who
                don’t mind the occasional raids by these first citizens of Corbett.

                Humored by the birds and chided by the plantation hands, our dear friend lives a charmed life. Idle afternoons are spent feasting on the spoils of the day, scheming for the next
                adventure or often in rapturous company of their cousins from farther lands who come bearing gifts like the robust and sweet, arabica coffee cherries. They make for excellent trade
                with the Kumaon sugarcane.
